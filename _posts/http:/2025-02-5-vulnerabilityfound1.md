<h2>Intro</h2>
During a security assessment of the Jasmin Ransomware, I discovered a critical SQL login bypass vulnerability in the administration panel. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system by exploiting improper input validation.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
Vulnerable URL: http://localhost/login.php
<br>
Attack Vector: SQL Injection via login fields
<br>
Payload: ' OR '1'='1

By injecting the payload above into the "Email" or "Access Code" fields and clicking the Authenticate button, the application grants access without requiring valid credentials. This happens because the input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to a classic SQL Injection vulnerability. I sent this vulnerability to packetstorm and they share them on their website. Here is my exploit!!!

<h2>Everyone's Favourite PoC Part (World's hardest vulnerability to exploit)</h2>

*--->  Navigate to the login page: http://localhost/login.php
<br>
<br>
*---> Enter the following payload in both the Email and Access Code fields:
' OR '1'='1
<br>
<br>
*---> Click Authenticate
<br>
<br>
*---> You will be logged into the admin panel without valid credentials.


Stay safe and hack responsibly (:DDDDD)
