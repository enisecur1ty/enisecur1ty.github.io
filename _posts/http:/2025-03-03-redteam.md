<h2>Intro</h2>
The things I write in this blog are not meant to be professional, but to track my personal development, take notes and look back years later to see the paths I have taken :)

In the past months, I studied for the OSCP+ exam, and at the beginning of February, I passed the exam and earned my certification.

 Since I am currently focusing on improving myself in Red Teaming, especially in the field of Active Directory, I decided to take the CRTP exam.

<h2>Finishh</h2>
Yeah, I've just started to learn two new languages: German and Japanese. Actually German is not that hard for me, but the Japanese is very difficult, I think it's the alphabet xD. I forget the CRTP hahaha, for the CRTP, i watch the videos about how people pass the CRTP exam, and read the blogs about the exam. So, I decided to made this blog, learn a little of powershell scripting, waiting for a return from my job interviews, and then sleep. I’m thinking of making youtube videos about my progress, but I’m so tired right now. Can I call this day productive? Actually no, in these days i don't have that much energy to ruminate. I get the OSCP+ certificate and still can't find a proper job, And i literally did everything i could to get a job. Maybe this should be a motivation to me. Tomorrow, I’ll come back even harder. This is it for tonight, take care of yourself, byeeeeeee.

So, if anyone knows these languages, please connect with me!
