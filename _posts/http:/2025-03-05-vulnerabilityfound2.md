I sent this vulnerability to packetstorm and they share them on their website. Here is the exploit code!!!

<h2>RCE Leading to Privilege Escalation: A Hacker's Dream</h2>

Ah, the sweet, sweet symphony of a well executed RCE that turns into a full blown privilege escalation!! If you’re reading this, you probably know the feeling :D it’s like getting the keys to the kingdom after walking through the front door unnoticed. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, let’s break it down, shall we?

<h2>The Setup: RCE – When You Just Want to Execute Some Code (and Break Stuff :P)</h2>
Remote Code Execution. The stuff of legends. It's the holy grail of penetration testing and, let’s be honest, every hacker’s dream. You find a bug, exploit it, and bam, you can execute arbitrary code on a remote machine. It's like sneaking into a party with no invitation, crashing the DJ booth, and playing your own playlist hahaha.

But here’s the twist... When RCE isn’t just a party trick, but the first step on a journey to root... oh boy, that’s when things get interesting.
<br>
<h2>Privilege Escalation: Because Regular User Access Is So Overrated</h2>
So, you've managed to plant your malicious code and run a shell. Congrats, you've got access to the system. But hold on, you're still a low privilege user. It's like getting into the club, but you're stuck in the coat check area, unable to pop bottles with the VIPs.

What do you do? You escalate, of course! Find a vulnerability, leverage it, and poofff!! you’ve got root privileges. Now, you're the owner of the party, in the VIP lounge, with access to everything. You're the bouncer, the DJ, and the bartender all in one.

<h3>How Does This Magic Happen?</h3>
<b>The Vulnerable Application:</b> Some app lets you execute commands remotely. "Hey, that's nice!" you think, executing whatever code your heart desires. But, surprise surprise, there’s more.

<b>Lack of Proper Privileges:</b> Maybe the app or the service you're exploiting runs with privileges that should never be exposed. Like, come on, why is an app running as root? <b>Security 101:</b> <mark>Don’t do that.</mark>

<h2>Affected Components (aka "Everything")</h2>
Once you've broken in, it's like opening the floodgates. Here's a quick list of what you'll be targeting in your little privilege escalation adventure:

The Operating System, Web Server, Probably EVERYTHING

<h2>The Aftermath: Now What?</h2>
Congrats! You've successfully escalated your privileges, and now you're living the hacker's dream. What do you do next? You could go full chaos mode, exfiltrating all the data, leaving backdoors, and maybe even causing a little mayhem. Or, you could just sit back, sip your virtual champagne, and watch the world burn (just joking i swear).

But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. As fun as this might be, don’t forget the ethics, guys. Just because you can escalate privileges doesn't mean you should.
